### Opening

Building off of Johari Windows by understanding our strengths as team members a little better

First, reflect on your StrengthsFinder strengths again; individual reflection; but also fun icebreaker could be to find people who have the same strengths? (I don't know those though since I didn't ask for submissions...)
Then pair up with former teammate -- describe strengths and ask for where they've seen it
Agile Manifesto -- finish out the mod strong going back to the 


### Individual Reflections
Reflect on your StrenghthsFinder results. How have you changed since you started at Turing?....How have your strengths helped you??

interacting with partners and teams. 

**Write:** 

* How do I feel like I have used my strengths when I've paired with others?
* How could I utilize these strengths more?
* What gets in my way or keeps me from fully using my strengths?

### Pair & Share: Inquiry 
Pair up with a former team member. Describe a few of your strengths to each other

* Have you seen me express these strengths? If so, how?
* What advice do you have on how I could express this strength more?

### Agile Review 
Read through the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) again. 

* How does this manifesto describe teamwork to you? 
* Is there anything missing that could describe a better approach to team projects?
* How is this manifesto relevant to the work you've been doing in Mod 2?

### Group Activity 
With your project team members/pair, discuss your approach to the project thus far -- how are each other's strengths being utilized? How do your strengths complement each other? 

Using the [12 principles of Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) as a model, work as a team to come up with a set of principles to leverage each team member's strengths and how this will positively impact your team for the rest of the project.

### Takeaways 
Groups share out takeaways on their manifestos.

### Goal-Setting
Now create some goals for yourself. Write in your journals answers to the following questions:

* As you finish up Module Two, what do you want to keep doing and what changes would you like to make?
* As you look ahead to Module Three, what do you want to accomplish? How will you do that?
* As you think about your upcoming job search, how will you approach it using what you do best?
